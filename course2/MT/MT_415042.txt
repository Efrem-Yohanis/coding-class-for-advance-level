Test Case 415042: Verify the File Name and Created Date for created submission proof

Manual test case - Steps and Expected Results

Precondition: User is logged in (shared steps 413501) and a submission proof will be created for an existing, uploaded ABSEE deal.

Steps:
1. Navigate to the ABS-EE Deal Home and locate the deal to test.
   - Expected: The deal row is visible and shows actions (View, Delete).
2. Click the "View" action for the deal.
   - Expected: The deal details page opens and the "Submission Proof" section/button is visible.
3. Click "Create" under Submission Proof and choose an option when prompted.
   - Expected: A confirmation dialog displays: "Do you want to include the contents of the EX-102 file in the submission proof?" with Yes and No options.
4. Choose "No" (create without EX-102).
   - Expected: The Execution Status tab shows "Submission Proof completed" and "CompletedSuccessfully" when finished.
5. Verify the File Name and Created Date for the created submission proof.
   - Expected: Filename is present and contains the job number (e.g., "<jobNumber>.html") and Created Date is visible with a timestamp.

Notes:
- Allow sufficient timeout for processing (e.g., 60–120s).
- Repeat the flow with "Yes" if you want to validate inclusion of EX-102 content.
